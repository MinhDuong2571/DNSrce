## Description
DNSrce is a simple DNS-based remote command execution (RCE) tool that enables a client to send commands to a server using DNS queries. The tool encrypts the commands, sends them to the server, and then decrypts the server's response. Built with Python, DNSrce utilizes DNS for communication between the client and the server.
